This is my collection of scripts involving puzzles.

/src/sudoku
The first script is for solving and generating Sudokus. It isn't the prettiest of code, it messes with strings a lot to avoid keeping track of all the nodes and removing individual cells, instead creating new ones and throwing out the old bunch. This may be a little slower in generating sudokus, but solving them it takes 0.17 seconds rather consistently on this machine.
